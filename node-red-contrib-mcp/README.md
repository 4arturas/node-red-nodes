# node-red-contrib-mcp

Model Context Protocol (MCP) node for Node-RED. This node allows Node-RED flows to act as MCP clients, enabling seamless integration with any MCP-compatible server (like filesystem, database, or API bridges). It is designed to be easily used by LLMs for tool discovery and execution.
